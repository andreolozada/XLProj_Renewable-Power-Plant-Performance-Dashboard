# Monthly Renewable Power Plant Performance Dashboard
This is an interactive dashboard for a renewable energy company that operates several power plants, showing month-to-date and year-to-date key performance indicators (KPIs) to get a high level view of how the plants are performing against targets as of any given month. Figures can be drilled down to per-technology or per-plant.

This project demonstrates the capabilities of excel in creating visualizations and data processing without the use of macros. The dashboard was created using a combination of formulas, pivot tables, form controls, named ranges, etc. No macros nor other external add-ons and resources were used.
